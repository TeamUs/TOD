            "this is one of the best soups i've ever made and it is even worthy of company.  so simple, yet rich in deep, mushroomy flavor.  the inspiration was zaar #26877, a delicious mushroom rice casserole.  i found i couldn't stop eating the liquid before putting the casserole into the oven and that gave me the idea that the base  would make a delicious soup.  and it does! \r\n",
            "use plenty of fresh mushrooms.  i buy them when they are marked 1/2 price at the grocery, as this is a good way to use your 'shrooms that are starting to get dark.  it is the soy sauce that transforms the broth from ho-hum to yum.  i try to use low sodium or home-made no sodium chicken broth so that i can use the soy for the sodium.  there is no sense of \"asian\" in this soup at all.  ( i would not make this without the soy. )  just a little bit adds the depth of flavor and even color that transforms the soup.\r\n",
